Objective For this ProJect:

To load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library in Python.
To create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data.

Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
Choose a dataset in CSV format (suppliment.csv).
Load the dataset using pandas.
Display the first few rows of the dataset using .head() to inspect the data.
Explore the structure of the dataset by checking the data types and any missing values.
Clean the dataset by either filling or dropping any missing values.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Compute the basic statistics of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) using .describe().
Perform groupings on a categorical column (for example, species, region, or department) and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.
Identify any patterns or interesting findings from your analysis.

Task 3: Data Visualization
Create at least four different types of visualizations:
Line chart showing trends over time (for example, a time-series of sales data).
Bar chart showing the comparison of a numerical value across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
Histogram of a numerical column to understand its distribution.
Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).
Customize your plots with titles, labels for axes, and legends where necessary.
